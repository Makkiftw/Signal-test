## Signal-test

# Description
Simple circuit simulator written in Ruby. The program was made with the intention of designing circuits and combining them to eventually simulate complex machines like adders, CPUs and perhaps entire computers. 
The project began the 4'th January 2019. 

I'm taking a small break from working on this project from now. I'm lazy and got other stuff to do. Feel free to contact me if there are any issues or improvements you'd like to see. The "ToDo.txt" file includes some planned features I may add later when I feel like it.
