## Signal-test

# Description
Simple circuit simulator written in Ruby. The program was made with the intention of designing circuits and combining them to eventually simulate complex machines like adders, CPUs and perhaps entire computers. 
The project began the 4'th January 2019.  

Update 07 Jan 2019:

After doing some testing I've realised the program runs very slowly after adding a lot of noddes and repeaters. This is likely due to the poor optimisation in my code and I'm working on it currently. First I have to figure out exactly what is using so much CPU performance.

# Launch
There is no .exe file attached yet.
The program is launched by opening "Main.rb" with ruby.

# Requirements
- Ruby v1.9.3 installed (only tested with v1.9.3 so far, but should work with all versions)
- Gosu v0.7.50 installed for Ruby (only tested with 0.7.50, but should work with all versions)
